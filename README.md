 *Finding TikTok Affiliates In Beauty*

This repository contains code for the process of extracting TikTok user's accounts for the purposes of finding affiliates for marketing agencies. The accounts must meet the following criteria:

- In the makeup, hair care, and beauty world
- Have less than 50K followers
- Have an email in their description

After scraping accounts and emails that match the above criteria, we leverage the Python SDK for Google's Gemini API to provide a brief summary of the eligible accounts using their TikToks and bio. Additionally, we provide a walk through of each individual python script in a notebook style README file.
